* Rules of JSX:
    * * Do not use JS-reserved words...
    * ---> class should be className
    * ---> for should be htmlFor
    * * There can only be one root element per JSX expression
    * * Any opening tags MUST have a closing tag
    * * Self-closing element MUST end with />
    * * Multi-line JSX expressions should be wrapped in parentheses
    * * Regular JS functions and expression can be run in {} (curly braces)
